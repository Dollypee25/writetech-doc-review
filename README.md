# WriteTech DocReview Series

WriteTech DocReview Series is a community-driven effort to improve the quality of technical documentation. This initiative allows community members to enhance their technical writing skills, build portfolios, and contribute to the improvement of documentation across various industries.

## How It Works
1. **Documentation Selection**: Community members choose the documentation they wish to review.
2. **Review Submission**: Members submit their reviews using the provided template.
3. **Review Process**: Each PR undergoes an external review by selected community reviewers, followed by an internal review by in-house technical writers, all within the same PR thread.
4. **Public Sharing**: Approved reviews are published publicly.

## Folder Structure
- **reviews/**: Contains individual review files submitted by community members.
- **templates/**: Contains the review template.
- **docs/**: Contains selection process and additional guidelines.

## Contributing

3. Submit your review via a Pull Request (PR) in the `reviews/` folder.
4. External reviewers will review your PR, followed by an internal review.
